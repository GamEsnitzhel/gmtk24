Made with Godot 4.3.

This game was made with ~5 hours of effort. Like ~30 minutes on Sunday, ~2 hours on Monday, and ~2 hours Tuesday.

It's really bad lol but honestly kinda fun sometimes but not really idk I'm just clicking random keys trying to make a coherent sentence because I'm currently procrastinating doing the other thing I need to do by noon pacific time (it's currently 10:18).
